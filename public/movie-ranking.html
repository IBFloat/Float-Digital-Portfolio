<h1>My 2024 Movie reviews so far</h1>
<h2>Follow me as I review three movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Godzilla vs Kong: The New Empire (2024)</h3>
<p>Wow, just Wow! After a great deal of analysis I can personally say that this film is truly a work of art.</p>
<h3>Atlas (2024)</h3>
<p>I actually liked it...I wouldn't say that it was phenomenal but it was good enough for me to get a lot of joy watching this movie thanks to it's good action moments</p>
<h3>Bridgerton 3</h3>
<p>The spectacular balls with the orchestrated pop songs and the old-old-old-school line-dancing continue to dazzle. Content collapsed.</p>
